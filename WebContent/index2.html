<div id = "demo1" style = "font-size:20px; text-align:justify"><b style = "font-size:25px">Software Engineer</b> : <br> <p>&emsp;&emsp;What is software engineering? Nobody seems to know. Everyone has an opinion, and everyone agrees that it is of the utmost importance, but there is little consensus as to what it is. But before addressing the above question, let us first answer the question: Why is it called "engineering"?</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;It is called "engineering" because early practitioners wanted to call it "software physics," but that term was already in use. They wanted to call it software physics because they believed that the process of producing software could be formalized with such rigor that it would be on all fours with physics. Indeed, texts from the '80s are populated with theories, derivations, tables, graphs, equations and formulae, apparently in an attempt to appear mathematical and scientific in nature. Within a few years however, the inadequacy of those books became clear, and the situation changed rapidly, and today's texts contain virtually no formulae or equations. In spite of that, the title software engineering has been retained, authors claiming in their introductions that, e.g., "Software engineering employs engineering methods, processes, techniques and measurement." Exactly what those engineering methods, processes, techniques and measurements are, is never stated, and the books never refer to them after the introduction. Of course SE is an artificial science, whereas physics and chemistry are natural sciences. Nonetheless, if it is a true science, and true engineering, we should expect to find some sort of system of laws and theories with experiments and predictions. </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;If we pick up an engineering book on how to design an automobile engine, we do not find sections on the waterfall model or the spiral model that we find in SE texts. We would expect to find sections on pistons and cams, and we would not expect it to contain sections on dashboard layout or cost estimates. And yet in SE texts we can find topics like screen layout and cost estimates, and we also see topics like team management, human factors, risk management and user interfaces, among others. Such topics are very important, but they belong to areas like marketing, management, IT and psychology, not engineering. Software production is very different from engineering, and it takes some imagination to see significant parallels between the two. A software engineer is no more an engineer than a novelist is a word engineer.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps the above observations are a bit harsh, and the problem is merely verbal and the title is a misnomer, a remnant from an earlier time. That is unfortunate, because the name implies scientific rigor, and opens software engineering to the charge that it is a pseudo-science flying under false colors. We would be better off if the name were changed to "software production techniques" or some such. </p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Back to the original question. There are many textbooks on software engineering on the market, and a survey of their indices and chapter topics reveals that they are very disjointed. One book will treat a topic as important, and the next book omits it entirely. About the only commonality to be found is the insistence that SE has something to do with engineering. That is due partly to the complex, amorphous nature of software production, and partly to a one-size-fits-all mentality. Software projects and programmers vary enormously, and some require vastly different approaches than others. Supposing that all software programs can fit under the same umbrella is a mistake akin to thinking that mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering can be lumped together. </p></div><br>

<div id = "demo2" style = "font-size:20px; text-align:justify"><b style = "font-size:25px">Doctor</b> : <br> <p>&emsp;&emsp;Doctors are often called life saviors. As medical professionals, they diagnose patients and prescribe the appropriate treatment for their ailments. Without medical intervention, many patients would suffer gravely. With the growing advancement in medical technology, the work of doctors has become more efficient and able to tackle illnesses that come their way. With a very demanding job, they work around the clock to treat patients to save lives. They put their life on the line and treat even the most life-threatening diseases.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;The field of medicine is vast, and doctors specialize in a particular area. Doctors with such specializations include oncologists, pediatricians, cardiologists, neurologists, general physicians, dermatologists, gynecologists, and psychiatrists. Doctors with specialties receive training in a specific field of medicine to deal with complex nature problems.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Rigorous training in the field of medical science is the prerequisite to becoming a doctor. In India, pursuing medicine is very common among students. They must take science subjects, including biology in grade XI and XII. Students must pursue their MBBS, which is for five years. To apply to medical colleges and universities in India, one must take the NEET or National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. This test is also applicable to those who want to pursue dental or veterinary science. Some universities, such as AIIMS and JIPMER, have their entrance tests. In India, along with allopathic doctors who specialize in Ayurveda and homeopathy, have clinics and practices. Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical methods in India. Ayurvedic doctors make use of herbal medicines to cure patients.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;However, the healthcare system in India faces many problems. Healthcare is not cheap. The private sector sets up hospitals in major cities, but the treatment is expensive. Tests as simple as blood tests cost is very high. These costs cannot be incurred by daily wage workers who have to go to public or government hospitals. These hospitals lack equipment and basic amenities, which delays proper treatment.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Doctors take advantage of the patient's lack of knowledge and sometimes prescribed tests that may not be required to earn money. They specify an unnecessary amount of medicines, which causes the patient to shell out a lot of money. The availability of doctors in rural areas s another issue as the profession has become more monetary driven. People in villages do not receive proper treatment as doctors prefer to reside in cities where they can make more money. There have been many cases with doctors who hold fake degrees. This practice poses a significant danger to a patientâ€™s life.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Every doctor takes the Hippocratic Oath, and through this oath, they swear to follow ethics laid down for medical practices. We commemorate National Doctor's Day on 1st July to honor the contributions of Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy and the doctors.</p>

<div id = "demo3" style = "font-size:20px; text-align:justify"><b style = "font-size:25px">Professor</b> : <br> <p>&emsp;&emsp;A professor is someone who instructs students in a wide variety of academic and vocational subjects beyond the high school level. They also conduct research and publish scholarly papers and books. They work in public and private colleges and universities, professional schools, junior or community colleges, and career and vocational schools.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Professors specialize in any of a wide variety of subjects and fields. Some teach academic subjects, such as English or philosophy. Others focus on career-related subjects, such as law, nursing, or culinary arts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Professors usually work for large universities. In this setting, they often spend a large portion of their time conducting research and experiments and applying for grants to fund their research. Frequently, they spend less time teaching. Classes may be taught by graduate teaching assistants, who are supervised by a professor. Professors may teach large classes of several hundred students (usually with the help of several graduate teaching assistants), small classes of about 40 to 50 students, seminars with just a few students, or laboratories where students practice the subject matter. They may work with an increasingly varied student population as more part-time, older, and culturally diverse students are coming to postsecondary schools.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Professors keep up with developments in their field by reading scholarly articles, talking with colleagues, and participating in professional conferences. To gain tenure (a guarantee that a professor cannot be fired without just cause), they must do research, such as experiments, document analysis, or critical reviews, and publish their findings. Full-time professors, particularly those who have tenure, often are expected to spend more time on their research. They also may be expected to serve on more college and university committees. Part-time professors, often known as adjunct professors, spend most of their time teaching students.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Many postsecondary teachers find their jobs rewarding because they are surrounded by others who enjoy their subject. The opportunity to share their expertise with others also is appealing to many. However, some postsecondary teachers must find a balance between teaching students and doing research and publishing their findings. This can be stressful, especially for beginning teachers seeking advancement in four-year research universities.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Classes are generally held during the day. Some are held on nights and weekends to accommodate students who have jobs or family obligations. Many professors do not teach classes in the summer, but they use that time to conduct research or to travel. Professors' schedules are generally flexible. They need to be on campus to teach classes and keep office hours. Otherwise, they are free to set their schedule and decide when and where they will prepare for class and grade assignments.</p></div><br>
